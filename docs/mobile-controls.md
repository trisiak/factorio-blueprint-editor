# Mobile / touch controls

Tracking doc for the touch-support arc: what's done, what's not, and where the
pieces live. Intentionally light — update the checkboxes as work lands.

Status: ✅ done · 🚧 partial · ⬜ not started

## Goal

Make the editor usable on touch devices without regressing the desktop
(mouse + keyboard) experience. The site used to hard-refuse to load on mobile.

## Architecture: explicit input mode

The page is in exactly one **input mode** at a time — `desktop` (mouse/keyboard)
or `mobile` (touch). They're mutually exclusive on purpose: running both
pipelines at once made touch taps double-act via the browser's synthetic
("compatibility") mouse events.

- Source of truth: `packages/editor/src/common/input.ts` — the `inputMode`
  controller. Auto-detects from `pointer: coarse` / `maxTouchPoints`, persists an
  explicit choice to `localStorage` (`fbe:inputMode`), emits `change`.
- Dispatch: `packages/editor/src/containers/BlueprintContainer.ts` reads the mode
  per pointer event. Desktop ignores `touch`; mobile ignores `mouse` and locks
  the canvas `touch-action: none`. Switching is live (no reload).
- Toggle: "Input Mode" dropdown in the settings pane
  (`packages/website/src/settingsPane.ts`).

## Done

- ✅ **Mobile gate lifted** — hard `MOBILE_DEVICE_NOT_SUPPORTED` block is now
  opt-in via `?desktopOnly`; touch devices load with an "experimental" toast,
  shown only once (persisted via `fbe:touchToastSeen`) so it doesn't nag on every
  reload. (`packages/website/src/index.ts`)
- ✅ **Blueprint persistence across reloads** — the working blueprint autosaves to
  `localStorage` (`fbe:blueprint`): serialized on `visibilitychange` (when the tab
  is hidden), restored on load. Clearing the editor (`shift+N` / emptying it)
  drops the save. A `?source` URL argument still wins on load (explicit intent);
  when both exist and differ, a toast offers a "Restore my saved blueprint" button
  (the mixed-state UX). `?source` parsing moved to `URLSearchParams` so raw
  blueprint strings (which carry `=` / `+` / `/`) survive. Storage + precedence
  logic lives in `packages/website/src/blueprintStorage.ts` (unit-tested); the
  loader wiring and autosave listener are in `packages/website/src/index.ts`;
  end-to-end coverage in `e2e/persistence.spec.ts`.
- ✅ **Pinch-zoom + two-finger pan** — framework-free `PinchPanRecognizer`
  (unit-tested), wired to `viewport.zoomBy` / `translateBy`.
  (`packages/editor/src/containers/PointerGestures.ts`)
- ✅ **One-finger tap vs. drag** — drag past ~10 px pans; release within
  10 px / 300 ms taps through the existing left-click pipeline (place / select /
  open unchanged).
- ✅ **Explicit desktop/mobile mode + double-tap fix** — see Architecture above.
- ✅ **Responsive overlays** — the INFO/shortcuts panel no longer overflows in
  portrait (`width: min(640px, 90vw)`, scrolls instead of clipping) and is now
  openable/closable without a keyboard (tap the corner panel; on-screen ✕). The
  quickbar scales to fit narrow viewports instead of running off both edges. The
  settings (dat.gui) pane gets touch-sized rows, a responsive width, and hides
  the keyboard-only Keybinds folder in `mobile` mode (driven by a `body.mobile`
  class off `inputMode`). (`packages/website/src/{index,settingsPane}.ts`,
  `index.styl`, `packages/editor/src/UI/QuickbarPanel.ts`)
- ✅ **Settings moved off the quickbar** — dat.gui's bottom open/close bar sat on
  top of the quickbar (desktop too); it's hidden and replaced by a Settings
  button in the top-left stack, with the pane re-anchored just below it (tracked
  via a `ResizeObserver` on `#buttons`). On mobile the top-left buttons
  (Discord / Github / Settings) collapse to a flush column of square icon
  buttons to save space. (`index.html`, `index.styl`, `settingsPane.ts`)
- ✅ **Test + deploy infra** — vitest (`npm test`), Playwright e2e
  (`npm run test:e2e`, desktop + Pixel-7 projects), GitHub Pages production
  deploy + per-PR previews (shared atlas, `.nojekyll`). See
  `.github/workflows/pages-*.yml`.
- ✅ **Canvas e2e probe** — everything inside the editor is one `<canvas>`, so
  Playwright can't query on-canvas UI through the DOM. Loading with `?test`
  installs `window.__FBE_TEST__.getState()` (logical input mode + quickbar
  bounds/scale/visibility, in CSS px); see `packages/editor/src/common/testHook.ts`.
  Opt-in, so it's absent in normal use. Extend its `EditorTestState` to unblock
  the deferred touch `fixme`s below (e.g. add blueprint entity count for
  tap-to-place).

## Not done / next

- 🚧 **On-screen action toolbar** — DOM toolbar mirroring the `actions.ts`
  registry into on-screen buttons, shown only in `mobile` input mode. Prototype
  landed: Items (inventory) / Rotate / Flip H / Flip V / Pick (pipette) / Undo /
  Redo / Center / **Cancel**. Buttons invoke actions by name via the new
  `EDITOR.callAction(name)` seam (`actions.ts`), so they stay in lockstep with
  the keybinds instead of duplicating logic. The Cancel button fixes the worst
  gap — there was previously **no keyboard-free way out of paint mode** (only the
  pipette toggle); `closeWindow`/Escape now falls through to a new
  `BlueprintContainer.clearCursor()` (cancels paint/copy/delete), and Cancel
  routes through it. Lives in `packages/website/src/actionToolbar.ts` (styled in
  `index.styl`, mounted in `index.ts`); mode-awareness via the new
  `Editor.onModeChange` / `Editor.mode` API (stable across blueprint reloads).
  e2e in `e2e/actionToolbar.spec.ts` covers input-mode gating, button presence,
  the `callAction` tap path, and the headline behavior — tapping **Cancel** (and
  pressing Escape) exits paint mode. The paint-exit tests dodge the
  tap-to-place blocker by seeding a quickbar item to enter PAINT via a keypress
  and reading the Cancel button's `.active` class as a DOM-observable proxy for
  cursor state. Remaining: real game-sprite icons (currently unicode glyphs —
  blocked on `.basis`→DOM delivery) and copy/delete-select buttons.
- 🚧 **Touch placement: preview + confirm (Slice 1 done)** — desktop previews a
  placement by hovering (ghost shows orientation/validity before you click);
  touch had no such step — a tap committed blindly. Now, in `mobile` paint mode a
  tap **positions/previews** the ghost (the touch analogue of hover) and only a
  **second tap on the same tile** — or the on-screen **Place (✓)** button /
  `Enter` — commits it. Rotate/Flip from the toolbar preview live on the
  stationary ghost; the item stays in hand after a placement (place several with
  tap-elsewhere / tap-again). Seams: `BlueprintContainer.handlePaintTap()` +
  `confirmPlacement()` (new `confirmPlacement` action), `PaintContainer`'s ghost
  show/hide, and the hover handlers gated to desktop so synthetic touch
  `pointerout` no longer hides the ghost. The ghost is also pinned to its tapped
  world tile while you pan/pinch (the camera moves around it) — `GridData`'s
  pointer-move tracking and the per-frame `recalculate()` are gated to desktop,
  so a drag no longer drags the ghost along with the finger. Covered by
  `e2e/touchPlacement.spec.ts` via the extended `?test` hook (`paint` +
  `blueprint.entityCount`), incl. a CDP one-finger-drag pan assertion. **Slice 2
  (next):** one-finger *drag* paints a continuous line (belts/pipes) — reuse the
  existing `gridData.on('update32', build)` drag-place path; tap stays deferred.
- ⬜ **Touch area/marquee select** — multi-select for copy/delete is desktop-only
  (drag with a modifier); needs a touch gesture (e.g. long-press-drag).
- 🚧 **e2e coverage gaps**: pinch needs CDP `Input.dispatchTouchEvent` (the
  high-level touch API is single-touch). Tap-to-place is now covered —
  `EditorTestState` was extended with `paint` + `blueprint.entityCount` and
  `e2e/touchPlacement.spec.ts` drives the deferred place/confirm flow.
- ⬜ **Pinch in desktop mode** — desktop currently ignores touch entirely, so a
  touch-laptop in desktop mode can't pinch. Out of scope for now (we don't care
  about touch-on-desktop yet); revisit if needed.

## Notes / tradeoffs

- `Editor.ts`'s window `pointerup` → `releaseButton` and `GridData`'s window
  `pointermove` still receive ghost-mouse events in mobile mode, but they're
  harmless no-ops (nothing held; the tap path re-seeds grid position before
  acting). Gate them if stricter isolation is ever wanted.
- Pen works in both modes (mouse-like on desktop, touch-like on mobile).
- The `/corsproxy` "import blueprint from a URL" feature is a Cloudflare Pages
  Function and does **not** work on GitHub Pages; paste-string import + editing do.
